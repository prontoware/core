This is the Pronto-Core project. Pronto core acts as the standard library of the Pronto programming language.

Features
- Comprehensive generic String support (see String<A> class). Supports multi-byte characters (UTF 8/16/24/32) with a generic approach.
- Collections (data structures) including Arrays, Lists, Maps etc.
- Byte packing/unpacking for serialization of binary files, network etc.
- File system support (beyond the native APIs).
- HTTP/HTTPS and SMTP client/server services.
- Vector and Matrix math library.
- Support for very large integers (BigInt class).
- XML/JSON native serialization support.
- TLS v1.2 (RSA, AES 128/256 etc.) support is native to Pronto now, no dependency on the OS/platform (other than true random number generation).
- X509 certficates and PKCS#1 support.
- AES 128/256 encryption/decryption support. Includes support for CBC and CTR modes.
- Native GPU programming support - see GPUBuffers.pro, GPULanguage.pro etc.
- Support for rendering text glyphs, 2D sprites, 3D meshes etc.
